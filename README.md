## 💻 Installation

First, download the sakila schema or sakila data, and open mysql then open script i.e. sakila schema - select all and run that file.

So, now sakila schema is installed at your end, now open script i.e. sakila data and select and run that file. 

All the data will be installed in that schema.

## 📚 Documentation 

There's a Movie Pictures Association that gives ratings to the movies on basis of the content, which helps their users to watch the right movie. 
So, for them I've analyzed the sakila database so that they can stock up the right inventory which can help their clients and improve their business too.
